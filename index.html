<h1> MOTHER EARTH AND LOVE!!!</h1>
	<P>I love mother earth and the power of luna and the energy of the forest! Meditating gives the breath to breathe and the earth <br>
	gives me the life to live.  The earth is love and tea is the expression of that love!!! I love tea and the natrual love that grows it.<br>

	Hello fellow tea enthusiasts!!! My name is Tiana Ells and I love tea,<br>
	and if you are here then you likely love tea almost as much as i do!
	
	<P> This homepage gives a list of resources along with tour guides of not only the herbs that make up the tea we drink,<br>
	but the love that goes into the life of the herbs we eat and drink every day. The love that we receive by partaking that which only the energy of live and mother earth gives and
	<br>not that of the blood of the earth!!!!
